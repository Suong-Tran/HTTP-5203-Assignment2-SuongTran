### Description
Implement the basic core functionality of the support ticket system using the XML files you've designed as the data sources.
#### You need to have:

* A user login
Users need to be able to log in and out.
* A ticket listing page
Admin/support staff should see all tickets while regular users can only see his/her own tickets. You should be able to click to open a ticket details page.
* A ticket details page
This page will display all the details about the ticket including the messages submitted. There needs to be a form to allow a user to submit a message for the ticket in question (the form only needs a message box and a submit button).
* The ability for admins to change a ticket's status
